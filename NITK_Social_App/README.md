# NITK Social Media App
## Description
To make studentsâ€™ doubt solving easy and save the pain of event organisers of spamming the event message in every WhatsApp group and more, this app will be the one stop solution.
Students will be able to ask doubts related to studies, and anything else, and those questions could be answered in the comments section of that post by the other users.
Since people may hesitate in asking doubts publicly, users shall be provided an anonymity option too with which they can ask questions anonymously!
If anyone is worried about missing any wonderful event happening in NITK, the app will take care of that too as an organisation can register their events and that will be added to the events list that will be visible to all users on the event page.
